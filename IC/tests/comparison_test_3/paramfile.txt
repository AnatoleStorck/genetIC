# Comparison for testing zoom with a constraint
# Here we generate an equivalent file at the same resolution as the zoom,
# for a uniform grid, to check (manually) the correlations come out the same
#
# constraint is on cell 97,97,97 which puts it right in the centre of
# cell 32,32,32 of a 64^3 grid
