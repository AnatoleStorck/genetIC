[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ucl-cosmoparticles/genetIC.svg?token=Ps3yU4QT9XRs2FGy3Bnr&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ucl-cosmoparticles/genetIC)

GenetIC is a code to generate initial conditions for cosmological simulations, especially for zoom simulations of galaxies. It provides support for 'genetic modifications' as described by e.g. [Roth et al 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07250), [Rey & Pontzen 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04615).
* The main code is written in C++ and can be found (with build instructions and a test suite) in the subfolder `genetIC`. 
* A toy 1D implementation in python is also provided in `toy_implementation`,  with a jupyter notebook to demonstrate.
* A set of python tools for development and testing is provded in `tools`.
