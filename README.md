GenetIC
=======

GenetIC is a code to generate initial conditions for cosmological simulations, especially for zoom simulations of galaxies. It provides support for 'genetic modifications' as described by e.g. [Roth et al 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07250), [Rey & Pontzen 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04615).
* The main code is written in C++ and can be found (with build instructions and a test suite) in the subfolder `genetIC`. 
* A set of python tools for development and testing is provded in `tools`.
* Documentation can be found in the form of a PDF user manual at *** INSERT LINK HERE WHEN AVAILABLE ***
* The technical underpinnings of the code are described in a release paper at *** INSERT LINK HERE WHEN AVAILABLE ***
