WARNING: Region selected for modification is the entire zoom grid. This is likely because the cell selection extends beyond the zoom boundaries.
By design, modifications are meant to be defined inside a zoom region. Increase the size of your zoom grid or decrease your selection to avoid nasty surprises.
WARNING: High-pass filtering scale: 64 h**-1 Mpc is greater than the rough window size: 16 h**-1 Mpc used for modifications.
This is prone to numerical errors when modifying the field. Decrease filtering scale to avoid it.
